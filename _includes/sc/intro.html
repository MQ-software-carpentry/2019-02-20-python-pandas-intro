  aims to help researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  
  This hands-on workshop will focus on getting practical work done using the the <i><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a></i>) module for python. Along the way we will review some basic concepts and tools although a familiarity with Python is assumed. The workshop will make use of <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a>, which allow for interactive coding and plotting all from the convenience of a browser.
  
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
